# JHWaveform

`JHWaveform` is An `NSView` subclass that draws a waveform overview. The view provides an optional ruler, grid and allows selection. `JHWaveformView` is able to graph any `float*` array, and a subclass, `JHAudioPreviewView`, attaches to an `AVPlayer` object and renders an overview of that player's asset, allows you to seek on the asset through the view, and renders the playhead position on the view.
